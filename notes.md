GitHub Copilot: # Business Intelligence Analysis for Food Vendor Survey

Based on the notebook you've shared, I'll provide insights and visualization code for your food vendor business survey data. Your survey covers several key business dimensions: ownership, leadership, planning, human resources, infrastructure, work environment, product quality, employee competence, documentation, and customer relations.

## Key Insights to Explore

1. **Business Formalization Gap** - Only a portion of vendors have proper licensing and permits as shown in your ownership data.

2. **Leadership Structure Analysis** - While many vendors have someone in charge of operations, other leadership aspects like quality control show room for improvement.

3. **Planning and Feedback Implementation** - Most vendors pay attention to food safety, but fewer conduct formal evaluations.

Let's create some insightful visualizations beyond what you already have:

### 1. Combined Socio-Demographic Profile

```r
# Create combined demographic profile
# Gender distribution
gender_plot <- dataactor %>%
  count(Gender) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100,
         label = sprintf("%.1f%%", percentage)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = label), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), 
            color = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  labs(title = "Gender Distribution", fill = "Gender") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

# Education distribution
edu_plot <- dataactor %>%
  count(Edu) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100,
         label = sprintf("%.1f%%", percentage)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = Edu)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = label), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), 
            color = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  labs(title = "Education Level", fill = "Education") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

# Province bar chart
province_plot <- dataactor %>%
  count(Province) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Province, n), y = percentage, fill = Province)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Regional Distribution", x = "", y = "Percentage (%)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

# Combine plots
(gender_plot + edu_plot) / province_plot
```

### 2. Food Safety Practices Comparison

```r
# Create comprehensive food safety practices visualization
safety_questions <- list(
  "Cleanliness" = "10. While working with food, do you pay attention to matters related to the cleanliness of the food (food safety) that is sold or produced?",
  "Guidelines" = "8. Are there quality guidelines and procedures related to food safety in the business?",
  "Safety Knowledge" = "70. Is there anyone at your business who understands food safety?",
  "Training" = "71. Have any employees undergone food safety or clean and healthy food preparation training?",
  "Basic Knowledge" = "72. Do employees have basic knowledge on food safety principles?"
)

# Create data frame for safety practices
safety_data <- data.frame(
  Practice = names(safety_questions),
  Proportion = sapply(safety_questions, function(q) {
    yes_prop <- prop.table(table(dataactor[[q]]))[which(names(table(dataactor[[q]])) == "Yes")]
    if(length(yes_prop) == 0) return(0) else return(yes_prop)
  })
)

# Create custom color palette
safety_colors <- colorRampPalette(c("#E07A64", "#66C2BD"))(5)

# Create the plot
ggplot(safety_data, aes(x = reorder(Practice, -Proportion), y = Proportion, fill = Practice)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.7) +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.1f%%", Proportion*100)), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.94),
            color = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = safety_colors) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Proportion", 
       title = "Food Safety Practices Among Vendors",
       subtitle = "Comparison of food safety awareness, knowledge and training") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "darkgray")
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), labels = scales::percent)
```

### 3. Business Maturity Index

```r
# Create a business maturity index based on key indicators
maturity_indicators <- list(
  "Licensing" = "3. Does your business have a business license/legality?",
  "Quality Control" = "6. Is anyone responsible for the quality and safety of the food sold/produced?",
  "Evaluation" = "12. Does your business conduct annual or periodic evaluations?",
  "Documentation" = "73. Are there records and documentation regarding the expiration date of raw materials, incoming orders, pest control, cleaning schedules for facilities and business premises?",
  "Customer Feedback" = "83. Do you ask for feedback/suggestions from customers regarding the food you sell?"
)

# Calculate maturity scores
maturity_scores <- sapply(maturity_indicators, function(q) {
  yes_prop <- prop.table(table(dataactor[[q]]))[which(names(table(dataactor[[q]])) == "Yes")]
  if(length(yes_prop) == 0) return(0) else return(yes_prop)
})

# Create a radar chart data frame
radar_data <- data.frame(
  Indicator = names(maturity_indicators),
  Score = maturity_scores
)

# Reshape for radar chart
radar_data_long <- tibble(
  Indicator = factor(radar_data$Indicator, levels = radar_data$Indicator),
  Score = radar_data$Score
)

# Create radar chart
ggplot(radar_data_long, aes(x = Indicator, y = Score)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = 1), fill = "#66C2BD", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#E07A64") +
  coord_polar() +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  labs(title = "Business Maturity Index", 
       subtitle = "Key indicators of business formalization and maturity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "darkgray")
  )
```

### 4. Customer Relationship Analysis

```r
# Customer relationship questions
customer_qs <- c(
  "82. Does your shop have regular customers?",
  "83. Do you ask for feedback/suggestions from customers regarding the food you sell?",
  "84. Have you ever received complaints from customers regarding the food you sell?",
  "11. Does your business follow up the customer feedback for improvement?"
)

customer_labels <- c(
  "Regular Customers",
  "Ask for Feedback",
  "Received Complaints",
  "Follow-up on Feedback"
)

# Extract proportions
customer_data <- data.frame(
  Question = factor(customer_labels, levels = customer_labels),
  Yes = sapply(customer_qs, function(q) {
    yes_prop <- prop.table(table(dataactor[[q]]))[which(names(table(dataactor[[q]])) == "Yes")]
    if(length(yes_prop) == 0) return(0) else return(yes_prop)
  }),
  No = sapply(customer_qs, function(q) {
    no_prop <- prop.table(table(dataactor[[q]]))[which(names(table(dataactor[[q]])) == "No")]
    if(length(no_prop) == 0) return(0) else return(no_prop)
  })
)

# Convert to long format
customer_data_long <- customer_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Yes, No), names_to = "Response", values_to = "Proportion")

# Create the plot
ggplot(customer_data_long, aes(x = Question, y = Proportion, fill = Response)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.1f%%", Proportion*100)), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
            color = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Yes" = "#66C2BD", "No" = "#E07A64")) +
  labs(title = "Customer Relationship Analysis",
       subtitle = "Customer engagement and feedback practices",
       x = "", y = "Proportion") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "darkgray")
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```

## Key Business Intelligence Insights:

1. **Formalization Gap**: Many small food vendors operate informally without proper licensing and permits, creating potential risks for both businesses and consumers.

2. **Food Safety Awareness vs. Implementation**: While vendors generally claim to pay attention to food safety, there's a gap in formal training, documentation, and standardized procedures.

3. **Customer Relationship Management**: Most vendors have regular customers but could improve on systematically collecting and implementing customer feedback.

4. **Business Maturity Variation**: The radar chart shows variation in business maturity across dimensions, highlighting specific areas for targeted improvement programs.

These visualizations help identify key intervention points for improving food vendor operations, safety practices, and formalization - critical aspects for APEC's food security and SME development goals.
