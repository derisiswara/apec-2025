## Use an AI LLM to generate stakeholder-relevant questions

> **For Example:**  

> "I have a sample dataset from an ecommerce company containing transaction records of product sold, date sold, the price in USD, marketing channel, region, and customer id. Can you help me think of 5 stakeholder-relevant questions I could explore in a portfolio project?"


- Spot the trend (e.g., big peak in 2020)

- Ask: Why did this happen?

- Drill into dimensions (region, product, platform)

- Identify patterns or anomalies

- Share findings with stakeholders

- Collaborate on next steps


## Guideline for picking visualizations

  

- Value Reporting: Just show the value of a metric

- Trend Over Time:

  - Line Chart

  - Area Chart

- Distribution or Mix:

  - Histogram

- Comparison

  - Bar Chart

  - Box Plot

  
  

## Do and Don't

- Dont use pie charts: Use area charts instead

- Turn chart titles into insights, not just labels

  - Instead of "Sales by Region", use "Sales are highest in the West"

- Use color for purpose, not decoration

- Be intentional top use a right tool:

  - Power BI, Looker, Tableau for dashboards

  - Python, R for custom visualizations

  

Perfection is not achieved when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
